# How to Migrate from Exchange 2019 to Exchange Online

Migrating from Exchange Server 2019 to Exchange Online involves several steps to ensure a smooth transition. Below is a comprehensive guide on how to migrate your email infrastructure from on-premises Exchange 2019 to Exchange Online. Please note that this is a general guideline, and it's crucial to adapt the steps based on your specific environment and requirements.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Review System Requirements
- Ensure that your existing Exchange Server 2019 is updated to the latest Cumulative Update.
- Verify system requirements for Exchange Online: [Exchange Online System Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/plan-and-deploy?view=exchserver-2019)
#
### 2. Prepare Your Active Directory

#### Verify Active Directory Schema
- Before migrating to Exchange Online, ensure your Active Directory schema is up-to-date.
- Run the following PowerShell command on a domain controller to check the current schema version:
  ```PowerShell
  Get-ADObject (Get-ADRootDSE).schemaNamingContext -Property objectVersion
- if the schema version is not up-to-date, update it.Ensure you have the necessary permissions, such as being a member of the Schema Admins group.
- Run the following command on a server with the Exchange setup files:
  ```PowerShell
  Setup.exe /PrepareSchema /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
- Allow the schema update to complete.

#### Ensure that users have the necessary permissions for the migration
-	Ensure that the account performing the migration has the necessary permissions. It's recommended to use an account with the "Organization Management" role in Exchange. Also add the account to the "Recipient Management" role group if not already a member.
- Delegate the necessary permissions for mailbox moves. Use the following PowerShell commands: 
  ```PowerShell
  New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role "Mailbox Migration" -User <MigrationUser>

**Note: Replace <MigrationUser> with the actual username**
-	If migrating public folders, ensure that the migration account has the necessary permissions.
- Run the following command using PowerShell
  ```PowerShell
  â€¢	Add-PublicFolderAdministrativePermission -User <MigrationUser> -AccessRights AllExtendedRights -InheritanceType SelfAndChildren
